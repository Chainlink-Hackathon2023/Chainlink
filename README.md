# Inheritance Wallet 
<hr>

Have you ever thought about what will happen to the coins in your wallet after you pass away? If you want your investments, which you spent hours on, to be in safe hands after your death, then you've come to the right place. Inheritance Wallet is a digital and web3-based inheritance system. After you pass away, your coins will be sent to the addresses you have designated as your heirs through our platform. All you need to do is write the wallet addresses of your heirs and determine the distribution ratio. Don't let death fool you!
